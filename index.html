                <h1>The history of barbeque ribs</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Ribs were originally the worst part of a pig and were considered a poor persons food. In the early 1600's poor people in the carribean islands started making ribs taste good by cooking them for long times over low heat. The recipe eventually traveled north via Spanish Conquistadors, making its way to the US.These were eventualy adapted and refined into the ribs we know today.</p>
